<hr>
<p><b><u><a name="1. Check mechanism">1. Check mechanism</a></u></b></p>
<p><b><u>1.1 From user's view</u></b></p>
<p>The user will see a modal dialog with:</p>
<ul>
  <li>A progress bar - Indicating progress on how many sites were checked so 
  far.</li>
  <li>A list control - Indicating currently running site checks and their status 
  (for example, <i>connecting</i> or <i>receiving</i>).</li>
  <li>A minimize facility - Will minimize WebWatch into the tray notification 
  area.</li>
  <li>An abort facility - Will abort the checker. It is emphasized that the 
  operation should be aborted in less than 5 seconds (if possible), contrary to old WebWatch 
  implementation.</li>
</ul>
<p>In the case when a check operation is dispatched while WebWatch is not the 
foreground window (e.g. in auto-checking), the checker should not grab user attention 
or interfere with foreground windows. After checking,  the user may be notified. Various notification mechanisms 
exist:</p>
<ul>
  <li>
  Notification icon animation.</li>
  <li>
  Play a sound.</li>
  <li>
  Display a message box.</li>
  <li>
  Restore window if minimize, flash window if not.</li>
</ul>

<p><b><u>1.2 From programmer's view</u></b></p>
<ul>
  <li>The checker takes a list of Site objects, without regard for site groups - 
  this is so a single site, or multiple selection of sites can be checked, and 
  not just a site group.</li>
  <li>At the moment, the core site checking is implemented using blocking 
  sockets. This mandates that each site check should be done in a separate 
  thread. This may change.</li>
  <li>The checker should be aware of site check error reporting (implemented 
  using exceptions).</li>
  <li>For each site checked, a verbose status string is generated. This is to 
  supply the user with more information when needed (the regular status 
  reporting is through colors of entries in the site list).</li>
</ul>
<p><u><b>1.3 Warnings</b></u></p>
<p>The check mechanism can warn the user about two kinds of situations:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Downloading more than X Kb of content - this warning is not implemented, 
  because at the moment the only method of notifying the user without making an 
  explicit error is something like a message box, which will interrupt the 
  checking process.</li>
  <li>Recursively checking a forwarded URL - this is treated as an error.</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<p><b><u><a name="2. A centralized data store">2. A centralized data store</a></u></b></p>
<p>WebWatch will use a centralized data store. The data store will contain the 
following:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Site groups, and therefore sites.</li>
  <li>Misc. settings (user interface settings, check settings, general settings, 
  etc.).</li>
</ul>
<p>The data store will also be able to perform persistence operations (saving 
and loading WebWatch configuration, exporting and importing site groups). Safety 
while saving configuration is crucial - 
<a href="#14. Configuration backup system">make a backup of older configuration file</a>.</p>
<hr>
<p><u><b><a name="3. Site and SiteItem">3. Site and SiteItem</a></b></u></p>
<p>In order to use a Site in a context larger than core manipulation itself, 
such as application features, we need to hold more data relating to the context. 
Thus, we derive a new class, SiteItem, from the core Site class. An example of 
such data, is the check-by-default field (whether a site will be checked when 
its parent group is checked).</p>
<p>A site knows about its parent group. The reason is to facilitate actions such 
a site deletion and moving of the site to another group.</p>
<p><b><u>3.1 SiteItem additional data</u></b></p>
<p>Additional information provided by a SiteItem is:</p>
<ul>
  <li><i>Name/Notes</i>.</li>
  <li><i>Check-by-default </i>- Provides information on whether a site should be 
  checked when its parent group is checked, Boolean.</li>
  <li><i>Verbose status message</i> - Provides a string that can be displayed to 
  the user about the state of the site, for example <i>&quot;Could not negotiate 
  secure link&quot; </i>or <i>&quot;Updated</i>&quot;.</li>
  <li><i>Site state</i> - Provides information about site state, for example <i>
  updated</i> or <i>erroneous</i>.</li>
  <li><i>Minor-update period information </i>- this consists of a start time of 
  the <i>minor-update</i>.</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<p><u><b><a name="4. Site list control">4. Site list control</a></b></u></p>
<p>A site list control is actually a specialized ListView control. Some 
attributes of the site list:</p>
<ul>
  <li>
The list acts on one site group, known as the 'current site group' in 
the context of the list. However, it can communicate with other groups - one 
purpose, for example, is to move a site to another group.</p>
  </li>
  <li>Supports resizing.</li>
  <li>
  <a href="#4.1 Columns">The ListView is in report mode and has 
  several columns.</a></li>
  <li>Supports sorting by choosing a specific column.</li>
  <li>
  <a href="#4.2 Site entry colors">Site entries have colors 
  representing their states.</a></li>
  <li>
  <a href="#4.3 Site operation handling">The list delegates site 
  operations to the site operation manager.</a></li>
</ul>
<p><b><u><a name="4.1 Columns">4.1 Columns</a></u></b></p>
<p>A site list is a report list and has several columns. The columns 
defined are:</p>
<ul>
  <li>
<i>Check-by-default</i> - Each entry has a check box specifying 
whether the Site will be checked when its parent group is checked. The original 
reason this is a column by itself is that the check box cannot co-exist (to my 
knowledge) with an icon. It is also added, that this solution is better than 
having two different types of data in the same column.
  </li>
  <li>
<i>Name</i> - The site name as given by the user.
  </li>
  <li>
<i>Address</i> - The site address as given by the user.
  </li>
  <li>
<i>Last update</i> - The time when the site was last updated 
(either the real time received by the site itself, or the time from WebWatch's 
point-of-view).
  </li>
</ul>
<p>The user should be able to change the widths of the columns (with 
the exception of the check-by-default column, its width is fixed), and this 
configuration should be persistent.</p>
<p><b><u><a name="4.2 Site entry colors">4.2 Site entry colors</a></u></b></p>
<p>Each site entry has a state. The state is represented by the text 
color of the entry. The colors are configurable, but the default is:</p>
<ul>
  <li>
Black - Indicates the site has no special state.
  </li>
  <li>
Blue - Indicates the site is in <i>updated</i> state.
  </li>
  <li>
Red - Indicates the site is in <i>erroneous</i> state.
  </li>
  <li>
Green - Indicates the site is in <i>minor update notification</i> 
mode - this is not a real state, overrides any other color.
  </li>
</ul>
<p><b><u><a name="4.3 Site operation handling">4.3 Site operation 
delegation</a></u></b></p>
<p>The list delegates site operations dispatched by the user to the
<a href="#15. Site operation manager">site operation manager</a>. Some of 
the operations can operate on a single site or multiple sites, they are denoted 
the M, others can only operate on a single site and are denoted by S. If the 
action was performed (and not cancelled), the site list control will update 
itself.</p>
<ul>
  <li>
<i>Check</i> (M) - Sort.</li>
  <li>
<i>Go to site</i> (M) - None.</li>
  <li>
<i>Copy address to clipboard</i> (M) - None.</li>
  <li>
<i>Set state to updated </i>(Mark as updated) (M) - Sort.</li>
  <li>
<i>Unset state </i>(Unmark) (M) - Sort.</li>
  <li>
<i>Begin minor-update period</i> (M) - Sort.</li>
  <li>

<i>End minor-update period</i> (M) - Sort.</li>
  <li>
<i>Add site</i> (special case - creates a new site) - Insert into list and 
sort.</li>
  <li>
<i>Modify site</i> (S) - Sort.</li>
  <li>

<i>Remove site</i> (M) - Remove from list and sort.</li>
  <li>
<i>Move site to group</i> (M) - Re-add the current group to the list (fully 
invalidate the list). - Notice that this action is not performed through the 
site operation manager. This is because the site operation manager doesn't have 
knowledge about site groups.</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<p><u><b><a name="5. Site groups">5. Site groups</a></b></u></p>
<p>A site group contains the following:</p>
<ul>
  <li>
Group name.
  </li>
  <li>
A list of sites.
  </li>
  <li>
A list of child groups.
  </li>
  <li>
Automatic checking information:<ul>
  <li>The <i>next-check</i> variable - This variable must be set when a group is 
  created, when the auto-check period data is changed and when the group is 
  checked.</li>
  <li>Auto-check period information.</li>
  <li>A flag to determine whether the group is included in the parent's group 
  auto-check process.</li>
</ul>
  </li>
  <li>Default proxy for contained sites.</li>
</ul>
<p>A site group can determine whether a specific site is included in the 
group's, or one of the child groups site list - and which group owns it.</p>
<p>Since the <a href="#13. Automatic site group checking">auto-check manager</a> 
works closely with site groups, it is declared as a <b>friend</b> by the site 
group.</p>
<p>A site group knows who is its parent group.</p>
<p><b><u><a name="5.1 Group check">5.1 Group check</a></u></b></p>
<p>A group can check the site it contains (either direct or indirect sites). It 
does so by gathering the sites needed to check (using a routine <i>AddSites</i>) 
and passing them to the site operation manager's check routine.</p>
<p>The <i>AddSites</i> routine is a recursive routine to add sites from the 
calling group and its sub-groups. <i>AddSites</i> also receives two predicates, 
whose job is to tell it which groups/sites should be added.</p>
<p><b><u>5.2 Exporting/Importing groups</u></b></p>
<p>WebWatch can export and import groups. Each exported group information file 
contains a single group, and any child groups it may have. Exporting and 
Importing groups is managed through the <a href="#2. A centralized data store">
store object</a>.</p>
<p><u><b>5.3 Moving a group to another parent</b></u></p>
<p>A group can be moved to another parent group. It is not possible to move a 
group to itself or to one of its child groups.</p>
<p><b><u>5.4 Merging a group into another</u></b></p>
<p>A group can be merged into another group. It is not possible to merge a group 
into its child group (but not vice versa!) or into the root group.</p>
<p><b><u>5.5 Site Duplicate Finder (needed?)</u></b></p>
<hr>
<p><u><b><a name="6. Site group tree control">6. Site group tree control</a></b></u></p>
<p>The tree will show group names with number of sites in parenthesis. For 
example: <i>All Sites (10), Private Sites (7), Public Sites (3)</i>.</p>
<p><b><u>6.1 Site group colors</u></b></p>
<p>A group's name will be highlighted using different (configurable) colors to 
represent different states, the default colors are:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Black - None of the direct sites in the group has <i>minor-update notification</i> 
  state or <i>updated</i> state.</li>
  <li>Blue - At least one direct site in the group has an <i>updated</i> state.</li>
  <li>Green - At least one direct site in the group has <i>minor-update notification</i> 
  state, overrides other colors.</li>
</ul>
<p>We have a separate color set for the groups tree, and not use the site list 
colors because the site list colors also specify a background, and so their text 
colors may not be appropriate for the default tree background color.</p>
<p><b><u>6.2 Site group operation handling</u></b></p>
<p>All operations act on the group and its child groups, where it's relevant. The operations are:</p>
<ul>
  <li><i>Add</i> <i>child group</i>.</li>
  <li><i>Remove  group</i>.</li>
  <li><i>Modify group</i>.</li>
  <li><i>Export group</i>.</li>
  <li><i>Import group as child group</i>.</li>
  <li><i>Check group sites</i>.</li>
  <li><i>Unmark all sites in group</i>.</li>
  <li><i>Merge into another group</i>.</li>
  <li><i>Move into another parent group</i>.</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<p><u><b><a name="7. Tray notification icon">7. Tray notification icon</a></b></u></p>

<p>WebWatch sets up an icon in the system notification area when it starts up. 
After a minimize operation, WebWatch can be restored by double clicking the 
icon. This is a usability feature - WebWatch has the ability to check sites as a 
background process (auto-checking). If auto-checking was set for at least one 
group, the tip for the icon shows the time for the closest automatic check 
process. When right clicking the icon, a popup menu is shown, containing the 
following items:</p>

<ul>
  <li><i>Show/Hide</i> (depending on the application window's current state)</li>

<p><u><b><a name="13. Automatic site group checking">13. Automatic site group 
checking</a></b></u></p>
<p>WebWatch can automatically check groups periodically. The automatic checking feature is managed through an automatic check manager. 
The auto-check manager performs auto-check maintenance by using the following 
algorithm:</p>

<p dir="ltr"><u>The <i>auto-check-algorithm</i>:</u></p>
<ol>
  <li>Get current time as <i>now</i>.</li>
  <li>Get nearest group to auto-check as <i>group</i>.</li>
  <li>If <i>group</i>'s <i>next-check</i> is below or equal to <i>now</i> then:<ol>
  <li>Check the <i>group</i> [see <i>check-group-algorithm</i>].</li>
</ol>
  </li>
</ol>

<p>It is important to notice that the check process 'knows' it is due to the 
auto-check. The reason for this is that sub-groups may or may not be included in the 
auto-check process of their parent group. It is also emphasized that 
auto-check inclusion is not mutually exclusive with auto-check for the 
sub-group itself.</p>

<p><u>The <i>check-group-algorithm</i> (step 3.1 of the <i>auto-check algorithm</i>):</u></p>

<ol>
  <li>Add all sites to check into a container - <i>sites-to-check</i> [see <i>
  add-sites-algorithm</i>].</li>
  <li>Pass <i>sites-to-check</i> to the <a href="#15. Site operation manager">Site operation manager</a> 
  for checking.</li>
  <li>Update <i>group</i>'s <i>next-check</i>.</li>
</ol>
<p><u>The <i>add-sites-algorithm</i> (step 1 of the <i>check-group-algorithm</i>):</u></p>
<ol>
  <li>Add all sites in the <i>group</i> to the container.</li>
  <li>For each <i>sub-group</i> in the <i>group</i>:<ol>
    <li>If the <i>sub-group</i> <i>included-in-parents-auto-check</i>:<ol>
      <li>Recurse for <i>sub-group</i>.</li>
    </ol>
    </li>
  </ol>
  </li>
</ol>

<p>The <i>next-check</i> and <i>included-in-parents-auto-check</i> variables are 
described in the <a href="#5. Site groups">Site groups</a> section. Since the 
auto-check manager works closely with site groups, it is declared as a <b>friend</b> 
by the site group.</p>

<p>The algorithms are partially implemented with help from the
<a href="#5.1 Group check">Group check</a> facility.</p>

<hr>
<p><u><b><a name="14. Configuration backup system">14. Configuration backup 
system</a></b></u></p>
<p>Upon start-up, WebWatch copies the configuration file, if it 
exists, to a per-run backup file. When saving the configuration, WebWatch copies 
the old configuration file, if it exists, to a per-save backup file. This way, 
even when WebWatch saved the configuration file more than once - the user won't 
lose the per-run backup.</p>
<hr>
<p><u><b><a name="15. Site operation manager">15. Site operation manager</a></b></u></p>

<p>The site operation manager is a collection of free functions, whose job is to receive one or 
more sites and perform some kind of operation involving the sites. An exception 
to that definition is the Add method, which receives no sites and returns one 
site (if the user actually added it). Functions that receive a single 
site, receive it by reference. Functions that receive multiple sites, 
receive them by two iterators, begin and end iterators (similar to the STL 
algorithms). The last statement means functions that receive multiple sites are 
templated functions (the iterator type is a template parameter). Some operations 
might need an extra window handle parameter.</p>

<p>It is emphasized that the site operation manager does not have knowledge 
about site groups.</p>

<p><u><b><a name="1. Socket Implementation">1. Socket Implementation</a></b></u></p>
<p>The goals in WebWatch socket library design:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Extensibility and object orientation</li>
  <li><a href="#1.1 Socket connection mode (plain/secure)">Either plain or secure 
  (SSL) mode</a></li>
  <li><a href="#1.2 Proxy support">Support for various proxy types (such as SOCKS4, SOCKS5, HTTP CONNECT and 
  HTTP GET)</a></li>
  <li><a href="#1.3 Transparency towards the user">All this as transparent as possible for the library user</a></li>
  <li><a href="#1.4 Robust error report system - Exceptions">Robust error report 
  system - Exceptions</a></li>
  <li><a href="#1.5 Abort-able socket operations - AbortIndicator">Abort-able socket 
  operations - AbortIndicator.</a></li>
</ul>
<p><u><b><a name="1.1 Socket connection mode (plain/secure)">1.1 Socket connection mode 
(plain/secure)</a></b></u></p>
<p>In order to provide the connection mode support (e.g. plain or SSL) an 
abstract base class, <b>SocketImpl</b>, is defined. It provides layers above it with 
primitive socket operations (connect, send, receive) and helper functions 
(send/receive with different parameters, resolve host address and more). 
<b>SocketImpl</b> works with TCP sockets. In order to support a client's abort 
requests, the class needs an <b>
<a href="#1.5 Abort-able socket operations - AbortIndicator">AbortIndicator</a></b> 
implementer object.</p>
<p>A plain connection mode socket class, <b>PlainSocketImpl</b>, is derived from 
<b>SocketImpl</b>.</p>
<p>A secure connection mode socket class, <b>SecureSocketImpl</b>, is derived from 
<b>PlainSocketImpl</b>. It uses SSL to establish a secure connection channel.</p>

<p><b><u><a name="1.2 Proxy support">1.2 Proxy support</a></u></b></p>
<p>Provided is a simple, direct-connection HTTP socket class. The class,<b> 
HttpSocket</b>,<b> </b>receives ownership of a <b>SocketImpl</b>, and uses it to do the 
actual primitives. The class will serve as a base class for proxy channeled 
socket classes. Two customizable actions are supplied - Connect and Create HTTP 
Request.</p>
<p><b>ProxyHttpSocket</b>, derived from <b>HttpSocket</b> is the base class for 
socket classes that use proxies. It supplies its derivatives with a proxy 
address.</p>
<p>Currently implemented proxy classes are: <b>Socks4ProxyHttpSocket</b>, <b>
Socks5ProxyHttpSocket</b>, <b>HttpConnectProxyHttpSocket</b>, <b>
HttpGetProxyHttpSocket</b>.</p>
<p><b><u><a name="1.3 Transparency towards the user">1.3 Transparency towards the user</a></u></b></p>
<p>A socket object factory,<b> HttpSocketFactory </b>is implemented. The 
arguments are:</p>
<ol>
  <li><a href="#1.5 Abort-able socket operations - AbortIndicator">An AbortIndicator 
  instance</a></li>
  <li>Connection mode: Plain/Secure</li>
  <li>If proxy is used (socket isn't direct), proxy type and proxy address</li>
</ol>
<p>Thus, for 2 and 3, a simple XML structure should be passed to the factory. Example 
configurations:</p>
<pre>&lt;Socket Mode=&quot;Plain&quot;&gt;&lt;Proxy Type=&quot;Socks4&quot;&gt;my.proxy.net:8080&lt;/Proxy&gt;&lt;/Socket&gt;</pre>
<pre>&lt;Socket Mode=&quot;Secure&quot;/&gt;</pre>
<p>The factory either throws a <b>SocketCreationError</b> or returns an 
std::auto_ptr&lt;<b>HttpSocket&gt;</b>. Therefore the only interfaces exposed by the 
socket library are <b>HttpSocket</b>'s and the factory's. Of course, the XML 
structure passed is also an important part of the socket library.</p>
<p><b><u><a name="1.4 Robust error report system - Exceptions">1.4 Robust error report 
system - Exceptions</a></u></b></p>
<p>The socket library uses exceptions to report errors. All exceptions thrown 
from the socket library code are either <b>SocketError</b> or derivatives. In 
turn, <b>SocketError </b>derives from <b>WebWatch::Core::Exception</b>.</p>
<p>The following exception types are defined:</p>
<ul>
  <li><b>SocketError</b> - The general socket library exception. Also serves as 
  a base class for other socket library exception classes.</li>
  <li><b>SSLError</b> - Thrown when there is a problem specific to socket 
  security when using SSL.</li>
  <li><b>ProxyError</b> - Thrown when there is a problem with the proxy.</li>
  <li><b>SocketCreationError</b> - Thrown when the socket object could not be 
  constructed. May be thrown from the constructor or HTTP socket factory.</li>

operations - AbortIndicator</a></u></b></p>
<p>The client of the socket library should be able to abort a socket 
operation (by calling an abort function from a different thread, for instance). 
Because the socket operations are quite low-level in the abstraction chain 
(above it lies the <b>HttpSocket</b> facility, and above that, a check method 
facility) we pass around an interface, containing a single pure function - <b>
ShouldAbort</b>, which returns a boolean value stating whether the operation 
should be aborted.</p>
<p>The <b>SocketImpl</b> class accepts a constant reference to such 
interface. Since an <b>HttpSocket</b> receives a <b>SocketImpl</b> instance in 
its constructor, we need to pass the interface to <b>HttpSocketFactory</b>.</p>

<p><u><b><a name="2. Check Methods">2. Check Methods</a></b></u></p>
<p>The main purpose of WebWatch is to check a given site (file, page) for an 
update. WebWatch can do this using several methods. The methods are divided into 
two main groups:</p>
<ul>
  <li>HTTP check methods (including HTTPS)</li>
  <li>FTP check methods</li>
</ul>
<p>In order to represent such methods, an abstract base class,<b> CheckMethod</b>,<b>
</b>is implemented. <b>CheckMethod</b> implements the <b>WebWatch::Core::Sockets::AbortIndicator</b> 
interface. All check methods are abort-able.</p>
<p>A <b>CheckMethod</b> can <i>Check</i> a specific site's state and return a <i>
CheckResults</i> XML structure. This way, the user can, for example, check for 
an update using the following algorithm:</p>
<p>Initial check:</p>
<ol>
  <li><i>Check</i> the site. Receive the state from the check method.</li>
  <li>Store the state in some place.</li>
</ol>
<p>At later date:</p>
<ol>
  <li><i>Check</i> the site. Receive the state.</li>
  <li>Compare the received state with the stored state.</li>
  <li>If the states are equal, the site wasn't updated since last check.</li>
  <li>If the states are not equal, the site is updated. Store the received 
  state.</li>
</ol>
<p>In order to work with check methods, the user shouldn't need to directly 
interface with low-level abstractions such as sockets or proxies. However, 
parameters passed to the check method may contain information used in the check 
method to construct such objects.</p>
<p>It is important to notice that a check method doesn't <i>have</i> to use the 
WebWatch socket library. This is the case with the current FTP check method 
implementation.</p>
<p>A check method can report about its status to a <b>
WebWatch::Core::CheckMethods::StatusNotifyClient</b>. The <i>Check</i> method 
receives a pointer to an object implementing the interface; if the pointer is a 
null pointer, no reporting is performed.</p>
<p>A check method has an <i>Abort</i> method, that the client can call at 
check time from a different thread. It is not guaranteed that the check method 
will obey the abort request and return immediately from <i>Check</i>, but it's a fine goal.</p>
<p><b><u><a name="2.1 HTTP Check methods (including HTTPS)">2.1 HTTP Check methods (including HTTPS)</a></u></b></p>
<p>WebWatch currently supports several methods for checking HTTP 
sites. Some of the methods have internal support for HTML, since it is common to 
use that format in HTTP sites. The methods are:</p>
<ul>
  <li>
  <b>CheckHttpSize</b> - Checks HTTP sites using the <i>
  Content-Length</i> field in the HTTP header.</li>
  <li>
  <b>CheckHttpTime</b> - Checks HTTP sites using the <i>
  Last-Modified</i> field in the HTTP header.</li>
  <li>
  <b>CheckHttpContent</b> - Checks HTTP sites by downloading the 
  site content and performing operations on it.</li>
</ul>
<p><b><u><a name="2.2 FTP Check methods">2.2 FTP Check methods</a></u></b></p>
<p>WebWatch currently supports only one method for checking FTP sites 
(files) - <b>CheckFtp</b>. The method checks an FTP file's state by retrieving 
file size and time last modified. </p>
<p>WebWatch also supports the Ident protocol for FTP connections. 
However, at this time, I use WinInet FTP support to implement the method. 
Because WinInet sucks, I cannot get the local port used for the FTP session, and 
therefore, cannot use the Ident server capability.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 700"><u><a name="2.3 Check results">2.3 Check results</a></u></span></p>
<p>The check results returned by the check methods are  XML structures. It 
is not obligatory to supply information about the structure, since they can 
easily be compared using the XML comparison support. But, it could be useful - for example to 
display more information about the state. A simple state, for, lets say site 
time could be represented like this:</p>
<pre>&lt;CheckResults&gt;&lt;Size&gt;123982&lt;/Size&gt;&lt;/CheckResults&gt;</pre>
<p>Notice the XML does not describe what check method is used.</p>
<p><b><u><a name="2.4 Initialization parameters">2.4 Initialization parameters</a></u></b></p>
<p>In order to check a site's state, a check methods <i>needs</i> a single 
parameter, the site address. However, some methods can receive more parameters 
affecting the underlying socket actions or even the states returned. For 
example, a proxy address (and proxy type) to communicate through, or filters to 
apply on the site's content.</p>
<p>Thus, the parameters are passed as an XML structure. An example XML for 
parameters to a <b>CheckHttpContent</b> method will be:</p>
<div>
<pre>&lt;CheckParameters Method=&quot;HttpContent&quot;&gt;
	&lt;Address&gt;http://www.mysite.org/&lt;/Address&gt;
	&lt;Socket Mode=&quot;Plain&quot;&gt;&lt;Proxy Type=&quot;Socks4&quot;&gt;my.proxy.net:8080&lt;/Proxy&gt;&lt;/Socket&gt;
	&lt;Filter Method=&quot;StripNumbers&quot;/&gt;
&lt;/CheckParameters&gt;</pre>

<p>WebWatch supports a concept called Minor Update (MU). The details of this 
concept are not important for us, but some clarification about its support in 
WebWatch:</p>
<p>When the user specifies an MU expiry date, the expiry is at this date, time 
23:59:59.999 (as in, midnight). This means, that if for example:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Current date/time is 2004/01/01, 05:00:00</li>
  <li>Minor Update expiry date is 2004/01/10 (time is 23:59:59.999)</li>
</ul>
<p>Then number of days until expiry is 10. If the current date/time becomes 
2004/01/10, 05:00:00, the number of days until expiry is 1. Minor Update times 
are always in GMT.</p>
