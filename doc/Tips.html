<h2 dir="ltr"><u>Useful information gathered while developing WebWatch</u></h2>

<p><u><b>1. A little about ListView columns</b></u></p>
<p>If you're using a slow graphics card and resizing columns in the report-mode 
ListView is slow, disable smooth scrolling (you can disable smooth scrolling 
using TweakUI).</p>

<p dir="ltr">A column width is automatically set to fit ListView contents if -1 
is passed to SetColumnWidth(). It is also worth mentioning that if one double 
clicks the header control in the divisors area, the column will be resized to 
fit.</p>
<p dir="ltr">It is usually a bad idea calling the DeleteItem() member of a 
ListView's header control child window. Call DeleteColumn() member of the 
ListView instead.</p>

<p dir="ltr"><u><b>2. Passing XML data as parameter is almost the same as 
passing a void pointer</b></u></p>
<p dir="ltr">You can have anything, including irrelevant data in the XML. The 
XML can only be examined at runtime, it is similar to using RTTI.</p>

<p><u><b>3. Having a simple swap() function for a class designed to be inherited 
from is a Bad Thing</b></u></p>
<p dir="ltr">The bad thing about it is that swap(), unlike the assignment 
operator, changes both objects. Suppose we have a class Base and a derived class 
Derived. Base defines a void Base::Swap(Base &amp;) function. Derived defines a void 
Derived::Swap(Derived &amp;) function. b1 and b2 are instantiations of the Base 
class, d1 and d2 are instantiations of the derived one. Consider the following 
cases:</p>
<pre>b1.Swap(b2); // OK
d1.Swap(d2); // OK
d1.Swap(b1); // Compile-time error: Base::Swap() is hidden and b1 cannot be converted to a Derived class.
b1.Swap(d1); // A not easily detected error: d1 is converted to Base &amp; - Only bases are being swapped (double-slicing effect?).</pre>
<p>One could imagine a solution to this problem using double-dispatch engines 
(multi-methods).</p>

<p><u><b>4. Nested class access to their enclosing class</b></u></p>
<p>According to the ISO CPP98 standard, a nested class does not have any 
significant privilege over other classes in regard to access to its enclosing 
class. However, there has been a Defect Report that says that a nested class is 
a member of the enclosing class, therefore should have access to everything in 
the enclosing class (like any other member). Therefore, the following example 
should compile:</p>
<div dir="ltr">
  <pre><code>class Enclosing {
    void Foo()
    {
    }
public:
    struct Nested {
        Nested(Enclosing &amp; e)
        {
            e.Foo();
        }
    };
};

int main()
{
    Enclosing e;
    Enclosing::Nested n(e);
    return 0;
}</code></pre>
</div>

<p><u><b>5. Efficient Pimpl assignment in derived classes</b></u></p>
<p>In base class, a pimpl assignment usually goes like this:</p>
<pre><code>Base &amp; Base::operator= (const Base &amp; other)
{
    if (this != &amp;other) {
        Base temp(other);
        std::swap(m_pimpl, temp.m_pimpl);
    }
    return *this;
}</code></pre>
<p>However, in the derived class, if we do the same (with the addition of 
calling the base class's assignment operator), we construct a redundant Base 
sub-object:</p>
<pre><code>Derived &amp; Derived::operator= (const Derived &amp; other)
{
    if (this != &amp;other) {
        Derived temp(other); // We don't need the base sub-object, yet we construct it
        static_cast&lt;Base &amp;&gt;(*this) = other;
        std::swap(m_pimpl, temp.m_pimpl);
    }
    return *this;
}</code></pre>
<p>A more efficient approach would be to construct a new Impl structure for the 
derived class:</p>
<pre><code>Derived &amp; Derived::operator= (const Derived &amp; other)
{
    if (this != &amp;other) {
        std::auto_ptr&lt;Impl&gt; newImpl(new Impl(other.m_pimpl));
        static_cast&lt;Base &amp;&gt;(*this) = other;
        std::swap(m_pimpl, newImpl);
    }
    return *this;
}</code></pre>

<p>Notice that in both versions, I have placed the temporary construction before the base class assignment in 
order to have strong exception safety (assuming the assignment to base doesn't 
throw after modification of the object, which as shown is achieved). Also notice 
that the Base can use this technique as well (construct its Impl instead of 
another Base).</p>

<p><u><b>6. Sometimes we need to define a destructor</b></u></p>
<p>Consider this class definition:</p>
<pre>class A
{
public:
    void Foo();
private:
    struct Impl;
    std::auto_ptr&lt;Impl&gt; m_pimpl;
};</pre>
<p>Here, we have a forward-declared structure, and an auto_ptr member variable 
that wraps it. If we don't define any destructor, the compiler generates one for 
us, but it sees only the forward declaration for Impl, so the deletion of the 
data results in undefined behaviour if a non-trivial destructor/allocation 
function/deallocation function are used for it. In this case, we need to declare 
the destructor and define it in the same translation unit as Impl is defined in, 
after it is defined - so the deletion will occur on a complete type.</p>
